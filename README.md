# Weather App:

### Building a weather application with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

### Original idea from [AsmrProg YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AsmrProg).
### You can find the relevant repo [here](https://github.com/AsmrProg-YT/100-days-of-javascript).

The HTML & CSS are from AsmrProg's code, JavaScript code is mine (I am not good at designing sorry).

# Home Page!
![Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourboyace247/Weather-Application/main/images/Home%20Page.png)

You can enter your Location (or any other city in the world) in the search input, and hit enter or the search icon.

# Results!

After you search your city, you will see the degrees in celsius, the percentage of humidity, the wind speed, and a forecast prediction of the weather for the next three days.

# Failed Results!

If you search for an invalid city you will get unsuccessful results (error 404).

## APIs:

The application uses the [OpenWeather APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api):

#### Use the OpenWeather APIs:
1. Create an account in the [plaform](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
2. Verify your account (you will receive the relevant email from OpenWeather to your registered email address).
3. Log in with your account to [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in).
4. Go to my [API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and make sure your API Key is active.
5. Copy and paste the API Key and Url inside your JavaScript(.js) file. Make sure you include them for features (weather, and the forecast prediction).

```JavaScript
const APIKey = " "; // Your APIKey here.
const url = " "; // Your API Link here.
```
